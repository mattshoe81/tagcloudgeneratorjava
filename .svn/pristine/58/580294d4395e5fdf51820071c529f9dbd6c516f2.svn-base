 * This program is written using the MVC design philosophy. The main method to
 * run the program is located in the view package, in the View.java class.
 *
 * As one would expect, the controller handles essentially all of the logic,
 * while the model serves as a container for essential data and data that will
 * flow between the view and the view and the controller. The view serves only
 * to toconstruct the GUI and contains the main method.
