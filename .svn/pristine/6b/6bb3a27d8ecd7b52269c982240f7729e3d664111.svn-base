Tag Cloud Generator:
 
 This program is written using the MVC design philosophy. The main method to
 run the program is located in:
 
             tagcloudgenerator.view.View.java
 
 As one would expect, the controller handles all of the logic, while the model 
 serves as a container for data that describes the program. The view serves only
 to construct the GUI and also contains the main method.
 
 The controller package performs all of the logic necessary to satisfy the 
 Project Requirements. The methods pertinent to grading are labelled with a 
 multiline comment that looks like:
 
     /*
      * ************************************************************************
      * ******************** Project Logic *************************************
      * ************************************************************************
      */
      
 and is terminated by a multiline comment that looks like:
 
     /*
      * ************************************************************************
      * ******************* End Project Logic **********************************
      * ************************************************************************
      */
 
 All of the other methods, as far as logic goes, simply serve to facilitate
 the MVC design.
  
 
 **IMPORTANT**:
        For Testing  Purpsoses, there are a bunch of files in the
        test/test-files folder, and to make things easier I included a .txt file
        in test/test-file-directories.txt from which you can just copy and paste
        into the gui to test its output, instead of having to type over and over
