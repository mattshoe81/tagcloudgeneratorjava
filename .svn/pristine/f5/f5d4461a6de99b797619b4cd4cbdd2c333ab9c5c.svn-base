 * This program is written using the MVC design philosophy. The main method to
 * run the program is located in:
 
             tagcloudgenerator.view.View.java
 
 * As one would expect, the controller handles essentially all of the logic,
 * while the model serves as a container for essential data and data that will
 * flow between the view and the controller. The view serves only to construct
 * the GUI and contains the main method.
 
 * The controller package contains (essentially) all of the logic necessary to
 * satisfy the Project Requirements. The methods pertinent to grading are
 * labelled with a multiline comment that looks like:
 
 * ************************************************************************
 * ******************** Project Logic *************************************
 * ************************************************************************
 
 * and is terminated by a multiline comment that looks like:
 
 * ************************************************************************
 * ******************* End Project Logic **********************************
 * ************************************************************************
 
 * All of the other methods, as far as logic goes, simply serve to facilitate
 * the MVC design.
 
 * The model.Model class also contains pertinent information as to the Project
 * Requirements. Namely its instance variables to store the tags and a single
 * method that performs a small amount of logic to add tags to the Map.
 
 IMPORTANT:
        For Testing  Purpsoses, there are a bunch of files in the
        test/test-files folder, and to make things easier I included a .txt file
        in test/test-file-directories.txt from which you can just copy and paste
        into the gui to test its output, instead of having to type over and over
