Tag Cloud Generator:

*** main method is in tagcloudgenerator.view.View.java ***   

File Structure:
        - "src" folder contains the packages for the model, view, and controller
            - "controller" package contains Controller
            - "model" package contains Model
            - "view" package contains View
            
        - "test" folder contains unit tests in the default package
            - "default package" contains the unit tests
            - "test-files" contains the .txt files used in testing the app
            - "test-file-directories.txt" contains the paths of the test files,
              to make testing faster by copy/pasting
            
        - "data" folder contains templates for the html and css used in the program
            - "html-templates" contains .html files with the static chunks of 
              html that can be read and printed to the specified output. 
              
 
 As one would expect, the controller handles all of the logic, while the model 
 serves as a container for data that describes the program. The view serves only
 to construct the GUI and also contains the main method.
 
 The Controller.java class performs all of the logic necessary to satisfy the 
 Project Requirements. The methods pertinent to grading are labelled with a 
 multiline comment that looks like:
 
     /*
      * ************************************************************************
      * ******************** Project Logic *************************************
      * ************************************************************************
      */
      
 and is terminated by a multiline comment that looks like:
 
     /*
      * ************************************************************************
      * ******************* End Project Logic **********************************
      * ************************************************************************
      */
 
 All of the other methods simply serve to facilitate the MVC design.
  
 
 **IMPORTANT**:
        For Testing  Purpsoses, there are a bunch of files in the
        test/test-files folder, and to make things easier I included a .txt file
        in test/test-file-directories.txt from which you can just copy and paste
        into the gui to test its output, instead of having to type over and over
